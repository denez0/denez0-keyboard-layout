17 keys are remapped relative to the standard QWERTY layout, so it should be relatively easy to change to denez0 (Deh-Nee-Zow/dɛnˈiːzə͡ʊ) layout. 

It took me 1 month of an hour a day practice to start typing really fast. 

I have used it only on Windows and Linux, so there are some ways which worked for me:

Windows
- run setup.exe in extracted denez0_Win.zip
- use denez0.klc with keyboard layout creator tool yourself
- manual key remapping with PowerToys if you don't have the ability to install previous 2 options
- VIA

Linux
- xkb files (Linux1) + Terminal (Linux2)

In case there are questions, feel free to ask, I'll try to respond in a satisfactory way.

Created with passion and consciousness to provide the best ergonomics experience with current keyboards, which are in no way ergonomic if you think about it. <3
