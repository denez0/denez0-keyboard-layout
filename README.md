17 keys are remapped relative to the standard QWERTY layout, so it should be relatively easy to change to denez0 (Deh-Nee-Zow/dɛnˈiːzə͡ʊ) layout. 

It took me 1 month of an hour a day practice to start typing really fast. 

I have used it only on Windows and Linux, so there are some ways which worked for me:

Windows
- open setup.exe in extracted deniz0_Win.zip
- use deniz0.klc with keyboard layout creator tool yourself
- manual key remapping with PowerToys if you don't have the ability to install previous 2 options
- VIA

Linux
- files (Linux1) + Terminal (Linux2)
